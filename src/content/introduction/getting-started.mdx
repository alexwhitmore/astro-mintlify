# Getting Started with the Epic Stack

The Epic Stack is a <ExternalLink url='https://remix.run/stacks'>Remix Stack</ExternalLink> designed to streamline your development process. Follow these steps to get started:

## Create Your Project

Run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeBlock code={`npx create-epic-app@latest`} lang='bash' />

This will:

- Prompt you for a project name (directory to store your project)
- Start the CLI setup process

## Navigate to Your Project

Once setup is complete:

<CodeBlock code={`cd your-project-name`} lang='bash' />

## Start Development Server

Launch your app in development mode:

<CodeBlock code={`npm run dev`} lang='bash' />

> This rebuilds assets on file changes.

## Check Deployment Instructions

Refer to the project's <ExternalLink url='#'>documentation</ExternalLink> documentation for deployment guidance. It's recommended to set this up early.

## Customizing Setup

To skip certain setup steps, use these environment variables:

- `SKIP_SETUP` skips running `npm run setup`
- `SKIP_FORMAT` skips running `npm run format`
- `SKIP_DEPLOYMENT` skips running deployment setup

So, if you enabled all of these it would be:

<CodeBlock
  code={`SKIP_SETUP=true SKIP_FORMAT=true SKIP_DEPLOYMENT=true npx create-epic-app@latest`}
  lang='bash'
/>

For Windows:

<CodeBlock
  code={`set SKIP_SETUP=true && set SKIP_FORMAT=true && set SKIP_DEPLOYMENT=true && npx create-epic-app@latest`}
  lang='bash'
/>

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Default User

The database seed script creates a new user with some data you can use to get started:

- Username: `kody`
- Password: `kodylovesyou`

# SEO

The Epic Stack provides robust support for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) through built-in Remix features and additional tools.

## Meta Tags

Remix has built-in support for setting up `meta` tags on a per-route basis. This allows you to customize metadata for each page of your application.

For more information, refer to the [Remix Metadata docs](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/meta).

## Robots.txt and Sitemap.xml

The Epic Stack includes built-in support for `/robots.txt` and `/sitemap.xml` using [resource routes](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/resource-routes) with the [`@nasa-gcn/remix-seo`](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/remix-seo) package.

By default, all routes are included in the `sitemap.xml` file. However, you can configure which routes are included using the `handle` export in the route file.

> Note: Only public-facing pages should be included in the `sitemap.xml` file.

## Customizing Sitemap Entries

Here are two examples of how to customize the sitemap on a per-route basis:

### Example 1: Adding Dynamic Entries

<CodeBlock
  code={`// routes/blog/$blogslug.tsx
import type { SEOHandle } from '@nasa-gcn/remix-seo'

export const handle: SEOHandle = {
  getSitemapEntries: async (request) => {
    const blogs = await db.blog.findMany()
    return blogs.map((blog) => {
      return { route: \`/blog/\${blog.slug}\`, priority: 0.7 }
    })
  },
}`}
  lang="tsx"
/>

This example demonstrates how to dynamically generate sitemap entries for blog posts.

### Example 2: Excluding a Route from Sitemap

<CodeBlock
  code={`// in your routes/url-that-doesnt-need-sitemap.tsx
import type { SEOHandle } from '@nasa-gcn/remix-seo'
import type { LoaderFunctionArgs } from '@remix-run/node'

export let loader = ({ request }: LoaderFunctionArgs) => {
  /**/
}

export const handle: SEOHandle = {
  getSitemapEntries: () => null,
}`}
  lang="tsx"
/>

This example shows how to exclude a specific route from the sitemap.

## Best Practices

1. Ensure all public-facing pages have appropriate meta tags.
2. Regularly review and update your `sitemap.xml` to reflect changes in your site structure.
3. Use dynamic sitemap generation for content that changes frequently.
4. Exclude sensitive or non-public routes from your sitemap.
5. Monitor your site's performance in search engines and adjust your SEO strategy as needed.

By leveraging these SEO features in your Epic Stack application, you can improve your site's visibility and ranking in search engine results.
